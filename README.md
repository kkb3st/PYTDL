# PYTDL
a python script which can download any youtube video as mp3 and mp4

## !!!NOTE!!!
Pytube does currently not support MP3 files, so this scripts download the videos as MP4 first and then convert it to MP3 with FFMPEG\
You need to download FFMPEG from the official website and then copy the ffmpeg.exe into the same directory as this scripts.
I'm sorry for that!

## Requirements
`python -m pip install pytube` (Windows)\
or \
`sudo python3 -m pip install pytube` (Linux)

## Usage
execute the .py file (YT_to_mp3.py for MP3 files, YT_to_mp4.py for MP4 files)\
then enter the URL to the video (just copy-paste from browser)\
and wait until itÂ´s finished.

you will find your MP3 / MP4 file in the same directory as the script.

have fun!
